1. 🎲 Dice Battle Game

Two players (Player A & Player B).

Click a button → roll dice (random number 1–6).

Show dice rolls, keep score.

First to reach 20 points wins.

Uses: state for scores, props for player components, events for rolls, conditional rendering for “Winner: Player A!”.

2. 🧠 Flashcard Quiz App

Show a flashcard with a question (“What’s 2+2?”).

Click card → it flips to reveal the answer.

Use state to track which card is flipped.

Add navigation (Next / Previous) to go through cards.

You could even make your React notes into flashcards — so you’re literally quizzing yourself with the app you made.

3. 🐈 Virtual Pet (Tamagotchi Lite)

A pet with hunger, happiness, energy (all tracked in state).

Buttons: Feed, Play, Sleep. Each updates the state differently.

If hunger goes too high, pet “dies” (text changes).

Add an image that changes based on state (happy/sad).

Bonus: Use useEffect with a timer to make hunger increase over time.

4. 🎹 Mini Piano

Render buttons like “C D E F G A B”.

Clicking a button changes background color and shows note name.

(No audio yet, just visual feedback).

Each key could be a NoteButton component that receives props (note, color).

5. 🎯 Guess the Number Game

Computer picks a random number (1–100).

User types a guess into input.

App tells you “Too High”, “Too Low”, or “Correct!”.

Count how many guesses it took (state).

When correct → show “Play Again” button.

6. 🕹️ Whack-a-Mole (React Edition)

Render a 3×3 grid of “holes.”

Randomly highlight one hole every second (useEffect + random index).

User clicks it fast → score increases.

Timer counts down from 30 seconds.

Game over when timer ends.

7. 🎭 Emoji Mood Tracker

Each day, user picks an emoji that matches their mood (😊 😡 😴).

Show a “mood history” for the last 7 days using .map().

Bonus: Use conditional colors (happy = green, sad = red, etc.).

8. 📅 Daily Habit Tracker

List of habits (Drink Water, Exercise, Read).

Each habit has a toggle (Done ✅ / Not Done ❌).

At the bottom: show % of habits completed today.

Could expand into a streak tracker.

---- 📝 Sticky Notes Board

Mark subtasks as complete.

Show % progress toward each goal.

------ 💡 Idea / Brain Dump Organizer

Add ideas with tags (e.g., “Startup”, “AI”, “Learning”).

Filter/search through them.

Mark ideas as “in-progress” or “done.”

Looks like a startup founder’s idea vault.

---- 🔮 Time Machine Journal

You add journal entries tagged with a date.

Slider lets you “travel” through time → shows only entries up to that date.

Like scrolling through your past self’s thoughts.
